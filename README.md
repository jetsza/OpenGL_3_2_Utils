Utility library for "Interactive Computer Graphics - 6th Edition"
====================================

## Description

The book "Interactive Computer Graphics - 6th Edition" by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner uses a small simple library called "Angel" ( http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/CODE/" ). 
This library add some utility functions to this library for some common tasks in OpenGL 3.x. This includes:

 * OBJ model loader
 * BMP image loader
 * Select buffer (usefull for selecting objects in a scene).
 
Most of these extensions depends on the "Angel.h", however it should be easy to update the code to use other libraries (such as GLM) instead.
